Coding Resources for Raider Robotics (Team 4698)

== Getting Started

Team 4698 competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC).  FRC provides many software tools and programming libraries that are used to create the program that runs on the robot's controller. It is possible to program using LabVIEW, Java, or *pass:[C++]*.  Our team writes the robot program in the *pass:[C++]* programming language.  As a first starting point, a basic understanding of *pass:[C++]* is necessary.  There are good resources online for learning *pass:[C++]* such as https://learncpp.com/[`learncpp.com`].  Chapters 0-8 and 13-18 will cover most all of what you will need for Robot programming.  It will be very helpful to have a Windows computer (preferably a laptop) that you can install a *pass:[C++]* compiler on to run your code as you learn programming.  

Coding tips:

* Learn `namespaces` as FRC software uses them a lot.
* Pay attention to class hierarchies and inheritance
 

=== FRC Game Tools Install

The FRC Game tools are the programs that handle the communication between the laptop and the robot.  The processor on the robot that controls all of the robot functions is called a RoboRIO.  The RoboRIO connects to the laptop in one of three ways: A USB cable, an ethernet cable, or wirelessly.  The RoboRIO is connected to a wireless bridge that creates a WiFi network.

The main application is the `Driver Station`.  It connects to the RoboRIO and can enable and disable the robot.  It also handles the joystick inputs to the robot and displays statistics and logging information about the robot's status.

The FRC Games Tools need to be installed before other components and libraries are installed.  The directions for installing are: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html[Installation instructions for the FRC Game Tools]. You do not need to install anything for LabVIEW or Java since we do not use those programming languages.

=== WPILib Library Install

The software library that FRC uses in called WPILib.  WPILib is very large and contains many elements including hardware interfacing, control systems, networking, and vision processing.  The Microsoft VSCode compiler and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are installed when the WPILib software is installed.  This should be installed after the FRC Game Tools.  https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html[Installation Instructions]

Some of the motors and motor controllers require software libraries that don't come in the WPILib libraries.  We use hardware that require the Rev Robotics REVLib library and the CTRE Phoenix Framework.  https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html[Information on installing these libraries].
